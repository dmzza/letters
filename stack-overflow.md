2 years after graduating, the thing I value most in a technology stack is convention over configuration. Ruby on Rails, Ember.js, Twiiter Bootstrap and even UIKit embrace convention in a way that makes them enjoyable tools.
I never thought I would become a generalist, but in many ways I'm glad that I did. I've become exposed to so many different programming languages and approaches to architecting an application.

Learning to build software is difficult because no set of facts or algorithms
that you can memorize will help you understand the tools, but learning by
experience is what attracted me to coding in the first place. When I first started
writing software, I often encountered what looked like a trivial problem that
became complicated. Sometimes I would work for hours hacking away using only
what I already knew about the framework. While I was learning Ember.js in the
beta days, I gained sense of smell for awkward code might be cleaner with something
I hadn't learned yet. These moments are the best opportunities to grow after you've
learned the basics. That lesson has been super useful when I learn anything
new, like Objective-C, Core Data, Ruby on Rails 4, or even Swift. Stack
Overflow has been the easiest tool for confirming my suspicion that there
must be an easier way.
