2 years after graduating, the thing I value most in a technology stack is convention over configuration. Ruby on Rails, Ember.js, Twiiter Bootstrap and even UIKit embrace convention in a way that makes them enjoyable tools.
I never thought I would become a generalist, but in many ways I'm glad that I did. I've become exposed to so many different programming languages and approaches to architecting an application.
